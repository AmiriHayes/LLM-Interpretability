The issue encountered was due to incorrect formatting of the JSON containing the Python code. The error was caused by the inclusion of 'python' as a prefix in the JSON. This has been fixed by removing the 'python' prefix and ensuring the Python code is correctly enclosed within triple backticks in the JSON structure.
