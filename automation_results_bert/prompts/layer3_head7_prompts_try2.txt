The error encountered in the previous code was due to the incorrect use of question marks '?' in the if and elif conditions checking token equivalence. To fix this, these syntax errors were corrected by removing the question marks, making the conditions syntactically valid for Python. The revised code ensures proper token comparison against the IDs for 'and' and 'because'.
